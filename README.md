Virtual Hackathon for Darwix AI

## About Darwix AI
Building the agent led future to level up customer conversations for omni-channel sales teams across the world

### The Premise
In software development, code reviews are the lifeblood of a healthy team. They catch
bugs, improve quality, and spread knowledge. However, they are often a source of
friction and a truly mundane task. Written feedback can feel blunt, impersonal, and at
worst, discouraging. A junior developer might feel attacked by a comment like "This is
inefficient," while the senior developer who wrote it was simply being direct. This
communication gap slows down learning and can harm team morale. Your mission is
to build an AI that acts as a bridge, translating raw critique into supportive,
educational guidance, thereby freeing developers from the negative cycle of harsh
feedback.

### Your Mission
Create a program that takes a snippet of code and a list of direct, critical review
comments, and then uses Generative AI to rewrite them. The AI should act as an ideal
senior developer or a patient mentor, rephrasing the feedback to be empathetic,
constructive, and educational, ensuring the recipient understands the "why" behind
the suggestion, not just the "what."

**Digital Skeptic AI** is an assistant designed to help readers critically analyze news articles. Instead of telling you what is "true" or "false," it highlights claims, examines language, and provides questions and prompts to guide your independent verification.
